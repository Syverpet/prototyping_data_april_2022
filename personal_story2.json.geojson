{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "name": "Meet Huleye", "descriptio": "Thiaroye is a town about 30 km from Dakar, the capital of Senegal. This is not a place that Poles often think about, but even there, the activity of the Polish Medical Mission is visible. One day, the Project Coordinator, Xymena Dyduch, learned from a dietitian about a child who had recently been a patient in the centre. Her condition did not improve and additional tests were needed, but her parents could not afford them. The PMM Coordinator asked for a meeting with the child's parents. She noticed a woman and a man with a baby in his arms. She learned that the baby was a 2-year-old girl named Huleye, who looked just 12 months old. The child was extremely malnourished, but the cause of the malnutrition was unknown. It was not known if the girl had days of life left or just hours. Thanks to the involvement of the medical staff and the financial support of donors of the Polish Medical Mission, it was possible to diagnose intestinal insufficiency and surgically unblock the bowel. Soon after the surgery, the girl's condition stabilized and her life is no longer in danger.", "image": "https:\/\/s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/pleo-polska-misja-medyczna\/Historie-osob\/senegal_history_Huleye_horizontal_mini.jpg" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -17.370333899999935, 14.757411200000035 ] } },
{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "name": "Meet Harriet", "descriptio": "In 2016 Harriet was 11 years old and lived with her parents in a small village near Blantyre in Malawi. Although Malawi is on the list of the world’s poorest countries, Harriet was happy – she had parents and was healthy. Unfortunately, the girl was hit by a car, and since then she has had serious problems with her leg. Not only was she unable to walk but her deteriorating health forced her to stop attending school and seeing her friends. The leg problems were only the beginning of the burden that little Harriet soon had to bear her shoulders. Within a short period of time her parents died. Harriet’s health was constantly deteriorating. The girl stopped eating and drinking and slowly locked herself in a world of her own, avoiding people. In 2019, Karolina Siwicka, an orthopaedist from the Polish Medical Mission working in Blyntyre Hospital, during a routine visit to various settlements, came across Harriet who was already in a very bad physical and mental condition. The doctors transported Harriet to the hospital and a complicated ankle reconstruction operation was performed. In the last months Harriet underwent several dozen procedures. Today she can walk on her own, has started eating and drinking, and is also under constant psychological care.", "image": "https:\/\/s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/pleo-polska-misja-medyczna\/Historie-osob\/malawi_history_Harriet_horizontal_mini.jpg" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 35.048532500000078, -15.763566699999956 ] } },
{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "name": "Meet Myat", "descriptio": "This was not my first mission. Waiting for the flight to Myanmar, I felt it would be a special trip. I said this to Justyna who was travelling with me. Me, a surgeon, and Justyna, an anaesthesiologist. The Wakema hospital does not resemble the place where I work in Poland. The high humidity made me feel like I was operating in a greenhouse. My attention was drawn to the involvement of the local medical staff. They wanted to learn from me. It’s nice that you leave a trace behind. I remember one day. It was no different from the others, and yet... Suddenly there was a noise in the hospital corridor. A nurse entered the room and said something I could not understand at first. I went out into the corridor and saw a boy with burns. The scars were so bad that he could not close his mouth. Justyna and I knew we were going to be asked to perform a surgery. There was no need to talk – we just exchanged looks; we wanted to help the boy. Myat was very brave and full of hope that we would help him. I wanted to do everything possible. During the operation the light suddenly went out. It would not stop us; we helped each other using phone flashlights. The surgery was successful. Myat got a new life, as it were, from us. He was leaving the hospital with a smile. This is a huge reward to a doctor. I will never forget this boy. Such moments are worth living for!", "image": "https:\/\/s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/pleo-polska-misja-medyczna\/Historie-osob\/myanma_history_Myat_horizontal_mini_2.jpg" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 95.177071200000057, 16.603293400000041 ] } },
{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "name": "Meet Emam", "descriptio": "Eman lived with her husband and three children at the Iraqi-Syrian border, near Mosul. She ran the house and took care of the children; her husband was an imam in the mosque. He openly refused to collaborate with ISIS when the warriors occupied their town. He ended up in prison where he was tortured; he spent a month in a cell suspended by his arms from the ceiling. After his release, he was arrested several more times so Eman decided they should flee to Kurdistan. She was expecting her fourth baby. It was in June 2016. They decided to run away at night; Eman set off first with the children while her husband was going to confuse the ISIS fighters and join the family a few hours later. She never saw him again. Some friends from the checkpoints said that he had not made it to the Kurdish border. Eman believes this does not mean the worst yet. She got to the Bahraka camp. It is home to nearly 6,000 displaced Iraqis. The camp is neglected, everything is in short supply but it is safe and the children can go to school. A son, Shamil, was born in the camp. He has Down’s syndrome and a heart condition. Thanks to the doctors from the Polish Medical Mission, he can be treated in the camp and they sent him to the hospital in Erbil. Eman is glad that it is only a 15 minute bus ride …and that Shamil is starting to crawl.", "image": "https:\/\/s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/pleo-polska-misja-medyczna\/Historie-osob\/iraqi_history_Eman_horizontal_mini.jpg" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 44.023438400000032, 36.246528 ] } }
